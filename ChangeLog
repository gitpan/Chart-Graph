	* Graph.pm : This is the first entry in the changelog. 
	1) added /usr/dt/lib to LD_LIBRARY_PATH for the xrt 
	   binary "graph". graph has rouble finding libMrm
	2) now searches environment variable TMPDIR for a 
	   place to store temporary files. Will default to 
	   "/tmp" if TMPDIR is not defined.
	3) fixed bugs in programs not found in the search path
	   i.e. Graph.pm will only search for programs needed
	   by gnuplot if gnuplot() is called. It will exit if
	   a necessary program is not found.
	4) added missing calls to carp for abnormal exits.
