Graph.pm - 28/2/99
Version 0.1

Graph.pm is a module that allows easy generation of graphs within perl. Currently Graph.pm supports two packages, gnuplot and xrt, both of which you need to have installed on your system. 

Please email at dmoore@caida.org if you have any problems!

INSTALLATION

To install Graph.pm on your system you need to run:

	perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make install

If you want support for xrt you need to compile the xrt wrapper executable and move it into your path somewhere:

	cd graph_xrt
        make 
   

USING Graph.pm

Graph.pm will probe your path if you do not supply paths to the programs that it needs. 

You need to set these variables if they are not in your path:

For gnuplot():
$Chart::Graph::gnuplot    # path to gnuplot 
$Chart::Graph::ppmtogif   # path to ppmtogif

For xrt():
$Chart::Graph::ppmtogif   # path to ppmtogif
$Chart::Graph::xrt        # path to graph(the xrt wrapper)
$Chart::Graph::xwdtopnm   # path to xwdtopnm
$Chart::Graph::xvfb       # path to Xvfb(the virutal frame buffer required by Xrt)

Currently Chart::Graph supports two levels of debug, 0(no debug msgs) and 1(debug msgs). You need to set the $Graph::debug flag accordingly. If you are having problems with Graph.pm set the debug flag to 1. Also Graph.pm will check $ENV{TMPDIR} for the temporary file storage. If you do not speicify, it will be set to /tmp automatically.
 
All the documentation(in HTML, with examples) for Graph.pm is located in doc/. Documentation is also available online at http://www.caida.org/Tools/Graph.
