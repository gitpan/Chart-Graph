NAME
     Chart::Graph - Perl extension for a front-end to gnuplot and XRT.

     23/4/99
     Version 1.1

SYNOPSIS
     #make sure to include Chart::Graph
     use Chart::Graph;

     gnuplot(\%global_options, [\%data_set_options, \@matrix], 
                               [\%data_set_options, \@x_column, \@y_column],
                               [\%data_set_options, < filename >], ... );

     #make sure to include Chart::Graph
     use Chart::Graph;

     xrt3d(\%options, \@data_set);

     #say for example we have a 3 by 4 matrix -> dataxy
     xrt3d(\%options, 
           [[data11, data12, data13, data14],
           [data21, data22, data23, data24],
           [data31, data32, data33, data34]])

DESCRIPTION
     use Chart::Graph;

     Graph.pm is a module that allows easy generation of graphs within 
     perl. Currently Graph.pm supports two packages, gnuplot and xrt, 
     both of which you need to have installed on your system.

     Currently the xrt3d package is not being supported, although
     it works. It is still in the development stage. Feel free to 
     give it a try though.

INSTALLATION
     To install Graph.pm on your system you need to run:

             perl Makefile.PL
             make
             make install

     If you want to use the xrt3d package, you need to build the "graph"
     binary in the xrt3d directory. 

USAGE
     Graph.pm will probe your path if you do not supply paths to the 
     programs that it needs. 

     You need to set these variables if they are not in your path:

     For gnuplot():
     $Chart::Graph::gnuplot    # path to gnuplot 
     $Chart::Graph::ppmtogif   # path to ppmtogif

     For xrt():
     $Chart::Graph::ppmtogif   # path to ppmtogif
     $Chart::Graph::xrt        # path to "graph"(the xrt wrapper)
     $Chart::Graph::xwdtopnm   # path to xwdtopnm
     $Chart::Graph::xvfb       # path to Xvfb(the virtual frame 
                                # buffer required by XRT)

     Currently Chart::Graph supports two levels of debug, 0
     (no debug msgs) and 1(debug msgs). You need to set the 
     $Graph::debug flag accordingly. If you are having problems 
     with Graph.pm set the debug flag to 1. Also Graph.pm will check 
     $ENV{TMPDIR} for the temporary file storage. If you do not 
     specify, it will be set to /tmp automatically.
     
     All the documentation(in HTML, with examples) for Graph.pm 
     is located in doc/. Documentation is also available online 
     at http://www.caida.org/Tools/Graph.
